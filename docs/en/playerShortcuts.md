# Player Shortcuts

## What it does

Adds keyboard shortcuts for YouTube player actions. Works in both fullscreen and normal mode. Each shortcut is shown as a badge in the button's native tooltip.

## Shortcuts

| Keys | Action | Fullscreen | Normal |
|------|--------|:----------:|:------:|
| `Shift+C` | Toggle comments panel / scroll to comments | ✓ | ✓ |
| `Shift+L` | Like / unlike | ✓ | ✓ |
| `Shift+D` | Dislike / remove dislike | ✓ | ✓ |

All shortcuts work on any keyboard layout — `e.code` (physical key position) is used instead of `e.key` (character).

## How it works

**Fullscreen detection**
YouTube sets an `is-fullscreen` attribute on the comments panel element when entering fullscreen. This is more reliable than `document.fullscreenElement`, which returns `null` when YouTube uses its own fullscreen implementation.

**Finding buttons**
Each shortcut searches two contexts in order: the fullscreen quick-action bar (`.ytp-fullscreen-quick-actions`) and the normal watch-page actions bar (`#actions`). Like and dislike are found by their custom element wrappers (`like-button-view-model`, `dislike-button-view-model`), which are language-independent. Comments in fullscreen is found by `aria-label` with a fallback to the unique SVG path of its icon.

**Triggering actions**
Each shortcut clicks the native YouTube button rather than manipulating DOM state directly. This keeps YouTube's internal state consistent (loaded content, animations, counters). The event is suppressed only when a target is actually found — otherwise the key is passed through to YouTube as normal.

**Comments in normal mode**
When not in fullscreen, `Shift+C` toggles between the comments section and the top of the page. If `#comments` is already in the upper half of the viewport (i.e. the user has scrolled to comments), the shortcut scrolls back to `#primary`. Otherwise it scrolls down to `#comments`.

**Tooltip badges**
YouTube uses a single shared `yt-popover` for all button tooltips. A `MutationObserver` watches it. Hover tracking via `mouseover` identifies which button is active — so badge injection is language-independent and works regardless of button state (e.g. "Like" vs "Remove like"). Badges appear in both fullscreen and normal mode.
